# NPB Moneyball Analysis

Applying analysis presented in the movie "Moneyball" to teams in NPB, including spending efficiency per win and on-base percentage, to determine cost-effectiveness of team and player.

## Cost per win
Collected data through web scraping and used Pandas Dataframe and Seaborn to visualize cost-per-win of 12 NPB teams over the last 5 seasons (2019-2023). 

Observation and conclusion can be found in the [notebook](https://github.com/annatakegawa/NPB-data-analysis/blob/main/cost_per_win_analysis.ipynb).
